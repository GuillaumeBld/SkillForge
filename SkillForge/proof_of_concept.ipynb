    "1. **Skill-to-Occupation Matching** - Match user profile to O*NET occupations based on skills, experience, and education",
    "2. **Skill Gap Analysis** - Identify missing and weak skills for target occupations with priority levels",
    "3. **Career Pathway Planning** - Generate step-by-step career progression paths with salary trajectories",
    "4. **Market Data Integration** - Real market salaries from DOL Apprenticeship Data API and demand trends analysis",
    "",
    "### Data Sources Used",
    "",
    "- **O*NET Database**: Occupations, skills, knowledge requirements",
    "- **DOL Apprenticeship Data API**: Real market wages by occupation/state",
    "- **O*NET-SOC Code Labels**: Occupation mapping",
    "- **JAAT Toolkit**: Skill extraction from resumes using NLx corpus",
    "",
    "### Key Functions Implemented",
    "",
    "- `load_onet_soc_labels()`: Load O*NET occupation labels",
