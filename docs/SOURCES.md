NLx Corpus: https://www.onetcenter.org/dictionary/27.0/text/

**Description:**  
The Job Analysis at a Textual Level (JAAT) toolkit provides natural language processing tools designed specifically for analyzing job postings and extracting O*NET occupational features. The NLx (Natural Language eXtraction) corpus contains millions of job postings annotated with O*NET codes, skills, knowledge areas, and abilities.

**How Used in SkillForge:**  
SkillForge leverages JAAT methodology and potentially builds upon the NLx corpus for training its skill extraction and job-course matching algorithms. The toolkit's approaches to identifying skills and competencies from unstructured text directly inform our core matching engine.

O*NET Database: https://www.onetonline.org/

**Description:**  
The O*NET (Occupational Information Network) program is the nation's primary source of occupational information. The O*NET database contains detailed descriptions of 1,000+ occupations, including required skills, knowledge, abilities, work activities, work context, and labor market information. The Resource Center provides access to data, tools, and research publications.

**How Used in SkillForge:**  
O*NET serves as the foundational taxonomy and data source for SkillForge's occupational and skill frameworks. We map courses, skills, and career pathways to O*NET codes and utilize O*NET's standardized skill and knowledge definitions to ensure consistency and labor market relevance across our platform.
